# Graduate-Admissions

• The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to help students during their graduate admissions process by checking if their profile matchs the requirements of the university which they are planning to apply or which they have already applied to.

• The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their admission chances in a university. 

• In recent years, the number of students applying for university has increased drastically, making the traditional review process tedious.

• In order to overcome this problem, universities can use this model to filter out low scoring or high scoring applications.

• In this project, we have found out correlations between all the variables and how they impact the dataset.

• Various visualizations are plotted to validate the hypothesis we generated. For building this model, we have used XLMiner and the Graduate Admissions dataset from Kaggle.
